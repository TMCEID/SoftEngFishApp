## 👥 Team Collaboration & Project Management

- Effectively distributed responsibilities based on skillsets (design, frontend, backend, documentation).
- Used collaboration tools (GitHub, Discord) to track progress and communicate asynchronously.
- Conducted regular team meetings to update progress, set goals, and resolve blockers.

## 🧱 Software Engineering & Design

- **Robustness Diagrams**  
  Created robustness diagrams to model the interactions between UI, logic, and data, ensuring consistent system behavior.

- **UML Sequence Diagrams**  
  Designed sequence diagrams to visualize object interactions, helping us plan the logic for key use cases like:
  - Ordering seafood
  - Logging a fishing session
  - Rating dishes

- **Use Case Analysis**  
  Defined clear use cases for each user role (Fisherman, Chef, Food Lover) to guide development.

---

## 💻 Development

- **Coding Skills**  
  Implemented functionality using Java and SQL (in IDE's like NetBeans, Intellij IDEA)
  
- **Role-Based Access & Functionality**  
  Developed functionality tailored to each user role, ensuring modular and reusable code.

---

## 🧪 Testing

- Performed **unit testing** and **manual testing** for key features.
- Identified and fixed bugs through structured testing scenarios.

---

## 📝 Documentation & Technical Reporting

- Wrote clear and structured documentation:
  - General architecture
  - Functionality per user role
  - Development process
  - Diagrams (robustness, sequence, use cases, class diagram etc.)
